# SnakeGameJS
The popular snake game in Java script

The game has a start/restart feature which initializes the game.
There is also a pause/resume button which lets you pause the game if you need to.

The snake (or caterpillar) grows when it eats any random apples on the field and has a little animation where its head changes to show that it "savours" the sweet apple.

Also if the snake turns on itself or bashes into the walls, it dies with an animation that changes the snake into a heap of skulls. 

Enjoy!!
